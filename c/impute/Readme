A brief overview of the algorithm. Note that the method is based heavily on subgroups.

   --For each observation
        Find other observations where the age/race/whatever is the same
        --The subsets are generated via SQL.
            --create a one-observation table.
            --for each element of the table of possible constraints,
                --D = select * from one-observation table where constraint
                --if D is not NULL, then the constraint is OK.
            --Now string together valid constraints to form a query; use that to pull the
                    NULL and not-NULL parts.
            --use the not-null parts to fill the model.
        Use that group to estimate the imputation model.
        Make multiple draws from the model, write to the fill table.
