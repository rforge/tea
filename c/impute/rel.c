/* This is a somewhat fragile model for hot-decking relation. It
   is designed to work in the context of Tea.

   We walk in with a list of potentially dozens of HHs,
    all in the subcategory we want; all with the same number of
    members.

    !! I currently expect to have a column named mafid, and a column named rel.
    !! I currently expect that we've already categorized by hhsize. This is
        a pretty strong dependency; maybe work around somehow?

    Here's a spec subset that meets the criteria:

group recodes {
    group id: mafid
    hhsize : count(*)
}

impute {
    category{
        hhsize
    }
    method: rel
    output vars: rel
    input vars: mafid
}


    Estimate step just writes them to a db table.

    If at the beginning of a household, draw step will select a new HH mafid,
    then draw its data to a static apop_data set. Then step through to return
    individual rel codes.
