/*
\ref init_edit_list : Here, we read in the peptalk file declaring the variables and the
edits, and then set up the one-zero matrix encoding all edits (explicit and implicit). As
long as your parent program is running, the em matrix will be there waiting to be used.


On threading: \c init_edit_list doesn't. It produces a single global em table, and sets
some auxiliary global vars as well. consistency_check is written to thread freely. That
is, the setup is write-once, query as often and as concurrently as you'd like.

/** There are three intents to this function, which you could read as three steps in a full
analysis:

\li Simply inquiring whether an input record passes edits.
\li Getting a list of fields that cause the edit to fail.
\li Getting a full list of alternatives that pass the edit.

Inputs:

\param record_name_in The list of variables that will be considered in checking the
constraints. This can be a subset of the full list of variables. Those not listed are ignored and can not cause edit failures.
\param ud_values The values you want the variables to have. A list of strings as long as
the \c record_name_in list.
\param record_in_size A pointer-to-int giving the number of records in the previous two
elements.
\param what_you_want A pointer-to-string (which is what R requires) that is one of
<tt>"passfail"</tt>, <tt>"failed_fields"</tt>, or <tt>"find_alternatives"</tt>.
\param id pointer-to-int giving a unique ID where I can file the output alternatives. The
row number is probably a fine choice.

Because there are three ways of running this function, there are three types of output:

\li In all cases, the \c fails_edits variable will be set to zero or one on output (where
1 means that the record does fail the edits).
\li For the second and third cases, I will fill \c record_fails, an array of equal length
as the input array of record names, with zeros or ones indicating whether the
corresponding field failed. If \c fails_edits is nonzero, then one of these elements will
be nonzero.
\li The full list of valid alternatives is not returned, because this is intended
to be called from R, and you can't return nontrivial data structures to R. Instead,
I save the result as <tt>alternatives[id]</tt>, where \c id is the unique id you input.
Any existing table at that point in the alternatives list gets freed when I write the new table.
