# This is a sample configuration file to accompany the 
# tutorial introduction to PEP.

# The input file, ss08pdc.csv, is the PUMS for DC, 2008.
# Errors have been inserted into the sample file for 
# demonstration purposes

# This file describes how that file will be read in,
# what consistency rules will be imposed, and how 
# some output tables will be put out.
