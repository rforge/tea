%just an idea: put silhouettes on the front cover

\begin{abstract}
TEA is a system designed to unify and streamline survey processing, from raw data to
editing to imputation to dissemination of output. Its primary focus is in finding 
observations that are missing data, fail consistency checks, or risk the disclosure of
sensitive information, and then using a unified imputation process to fix all of these
issues. Beyond this central focus, it includes tools for reading in data, generating
fully synthetic data, and other typical needs of the survey processor.
\end{abstract}


\section{Overview}
{\sc We intend} to implement the many steps of survey processing into a single
framework, where the interface with which analysts work is common across surveys,
the full description of how a survey is processed is summarized in one place, and the
code implementing the procedures are internally well-documented and reasonably easy
to maintain.

Raw data is often rife with missing items, logical errors, and sensitive information. 
To ignore these issues risks alienating respondents and data users alike, and so data 
modification is a necessary part of the production of quality survey and census data. 
TEA is a statistical library designed to eradicate these errors by creating a framework 
that is friendly to interact with, effectively handles Census-sized data sets, and does 
the processing quickly even with relatively sophisticated methods.

This paper gives a detailed overview of the TEA system, its components, and how they're 
used. If you have this tutorial you should also have a working installation of TEA and 
a sample directory including {\tt demo.spec, demo.R}, and {\tt dc\_pums\_08.csv}. 
Basic versions of all of the steps described below are already implemented and running,
though the system will evolve and grow as it is applied in new surveys and environments.

\section{System basics}
TEA implements a two step process for addressing issues with raw data. The first is to
identify those failures listed above (missing data, logical errors, or sensitive
information), and then, having identified problem data, impute new values
to replace the old ones. Although the term {\em imputation} is typically used only to 
describe filling in missing data, we use it broadly to mean any modification of a 
data item that involves choosing among alternatives, regardless of which of the 
above failures prompted the fill-in. 

In terms of how TEA is implemented, we break the process into two parts: the 
specification of variable details---such as which file to read in, what values should 
be top-coded, or the full description of the model used for filling in missing 
data---and the actual prodecure to be run by the computer based on those inputs. 
The specification of details as mentioned above will go into a plain text file, 
herein called the {\tt spec} file. Based on your inputs to the {\tt spec} file 
(which we will explain later as to what those inputs are/can be), you then run 
a script in a user-friendly statistical computing framework called {\bf R}. This is 
where the computing (editing, imputation, etc) takes place. We will explain this in 
more detail later as well. For now, let's look closer at the {\tt spec} file: 

\subsection{The spec file}\label{specsec}
The full specification of the various steps of TEA, from input of data to final 
production of output tables, that are performed during your implementation of TEA 
is specified in a single file, the {\em spec file}. There are several intents to 
this setup. First, because the spec file is separate from programming
languages like R or SAS, it is a simpler grammar that is easier to write, and so 
analysts can write technical specifications without the assistance of a programmer or
a full training in a new programming language. In other words, the spec file allows 
users whose areas of expertise are not in programming to customize and use TEA in a 
standardized and acccessible environment. To see why this is the case, observe the 
following script that is taken from the {\tt demo.spec} file (which you can open using 
Vi or any other text editor):

\begin{verbatim}
database: test.db

input {
        input_file :dc_pums_08.csv
        output_table: dc_pums
}
\end{verbatim}

In this snippet of the {\tt demo.spec} file, we specified a database to use, an input 
file to be parsed, and an output table to write our imputations to. Behind the scenes, 
SQL scripts and C functions are being executed. As we will see, other scripts that are 
run from the {\tt spec} file perform more complicated behind-the-scenes algorithms. 
However, before we go through an example of a full {\tt spec} file, let's take a look at 
the environment and underlying systems in which TEA runs to gain a better understanding 
of the processes taking place in the {\tt spec} file:

\subsection{Environment and underlying systems}
TEA is based on three systems: C, R, and SQL.\comment{\footnote{C is the successor to B, which
was the successor to BCPL: basic combined programming language. R, a successor to S,
is named after its authors, Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka. SQL stands for structured
query language.}} Each provides facilities that complement the others:

{\bf SQL} is designed around making fast queries from databases, such as finding all
observations within a given age range and income band. Any time we need a subset of the
data, we will use SQL to describe and pull it. SQL is a relatively simple language, so
users unfamiliar with it can probably learn the necessary SQL in a few
minutes---in fact, a reader who claims to know no SQL will probably already be able
to read and modify the SQL-language conditions in the {\tt checks} sections below.

The TEA system stores data using an SQL database. The system queries the database as
needed to provide input to the statistical/mathematical components (R, C function libraries, etc.).
Currently, TEA is written to support SQLite as its database interface; however it would
be possible to implement other interfaces such as Oracle or MySQL.

Output at each step is also to the database, to be read as input into the next
step. Therefore, the state of the data is recorded at each step in the process, so
suspect changes may be audited.

Outside the database, to control what happens and
do the modeling, the TEA package consists of roughly 5,000 lines of R and C code.

{\bf R} is a relatively user-friendly system that makes it easy to interact with data
sets and write quick scripts to glue together segments of the survey-processing pipeline.
R is therefore the interactive front-end for TEA. Users will want to get familiar with the basics of
R.  As with SQL, users well-versed in R can use their additional knowledge to perform
analysis beyond the tools provided by the TEA system.

{\bf C} is the fastest human-usable system available for manipulating matrices, making
draws from distributions, and other basic model manipulations. Most of the numerical
work will be in C. The user is not expected to know any C at all, because R procedures
are provided that do the work of running the underlying C-based procedures.

Now that we have a better idea of the environments in which TEA is run, let's take a look  
at an example of a full {\tt spec} file: {\tt demo.spec}:

\comment{
DV:  I thought it would be a good idea to include a full spec file for the reader to 
reference while reading through the tutorial. If you guys disagree we can take it out.
Also, as we know there are problems with demo.spec so we'll have to fix those eventually 
before including it in the final draft of the tutorial.

\begin{figure}

\caption{A sample {\tt spec} file that imputes an AGEP variable using WAGP, SEX, 
and the {\tt hot deck} and {\tt ols} imputation models. The contents of this {\tt spec} 
file are explained below}
\end{figure}
}
The configuration system (spec file) is a major part of the user interface with TEA. As is evident 
from {\tt demo.spec}, there are many components of the {\tt spec} file that all perform certain functions. 
We begin by explaining the concept of \textit{keys:}

\subsection{Keys}
Everything in the {\tt spec} file is a key/value pair (or, as may be more familiar to 
you, a tag: data definition). Each key in the {\tt spec} file has a specific purpose and 
will be outlined in this tutorial.
To begin, we start in the header of {\tt demo.spec}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=]
database: demo.db
id: SSN
\end{lstlisting}

Here, {\tt database: demo.db} and {\tt id: SSN} are examples of key: value pairs.
As is the case in {\tt demo.spec}, you will always need to begin your {\tt spec} file by declaring the 
database ({\tt database:your\_database.db}) key and the unique identifier 
({\tt id:your\_unique\_identifier}) key. The {\tt database:} key identifies 
the relational database where all of your data will be manipulated during the various processes of TEA. 
The {\tt id} key provides a column in the database table that serves as the unique identifier for 
each set of data points in your data set. Though the {\tt id} key is not strictly necessary, 
we strongly advise that you include one in your {\tt spec} file to prevent any unnecessary frustration 
as most of TEA's routines require its use. More information on both of these keys can be found in 
the appendix of this tutorial.\\

You may have noticed that keys are assigned values with the following syntax:\\

{\tt key: value}\\

This syntax is equivalent to the following form with curly braces:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=]
database{
	demo.db
}

id {
	SSN
}
\end{lstlisting}

Clearly, this form is not as convenient as the {\tt key: value} form for single values. However, it allows 
us to have multiple values associated with a single line of data, and even subkeys. For example, take  
the next line in {\tt demo.spec} (the computer will 
ignore everything after a \#, so those lines are comments for your fellow humans):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=]
input {
    #As above, if you have a key with one value, you can use a colon:
    input file: ss08pdc.csv
    overwrite: no
    output table: dc
	#However, with curly braces we can associate multiple values with a single key
        types {
                AGEP: integer
                CATAGE: integer
        }
}
\end{lstlisting}

%  DV: Here we should explain how subkeys are used (a fact of which I'm not entirely 
%  sure myself). After explaining this we have:

In the database, here is what the above will look like:
\begin{verbatim}
database            ourstudy.db
checks              age > 100 => age = 100
checks              status = 'married' and  age < 16
input/input file    text_in.csv
input/output table  dataset
\end{verbatim}

Observe that the subkeys are turned into a slash-separated list. It is 
worth getting familiar with this internal form, because when you've made a 
mistake in your {\tt spec} file, the error message that gets printed in {\tt R} 
will display your keys in the above form. We will discuss this more later in the 
tutorial when we talk about running your {\tt spec} file in {\tt R}.
Here is a succint summation of the syntax rules for keys:

\begin{itemize}
\item You can have several values in curly braces, each on a separate line, which are added to the key/value list. Order is preserved.
\item If there is a subkey, then its name is merged with the parent key via a slash;
you can have as many levels of sub-sub-sub-keys as you wish.
%\item You will almost certainly
%need to use this group/key format to get most values. Some functions still call for
%a group and key separately, but they'll just get merged with a slash anyway.
\item As a shortcut, you can replace {\tt key \{single value\}} with {\tt key:single value}.
\item Each key takes up exactly one line (unless you explicitly combine lines; see below). Otherwise, white
space is irrelevant to the parser. Because humans will also read the spec file, you
are strongly encouraged to use indentation to indicate what is a member of what group.
\item If you need to continue a value over several lines, put a backslash at the end of
each line that continues to the next; the backslash/newline will be replaced with a single space.
\end{itemize}

We now continue through our {\tt spec} file to the {\tt input} key:

\subsection{Input declarations}
The {\tt input} key is an important key in your {\tt spec} file that specifies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The {\tt csv} file from which you will draw your data.
\item The option to \textit{overwrite} the csv file currently written into the specified database with 
a new csv file that you have specified.
\item The {\tt output table} key that specifies the table where you would like to 
write the data that is read in from the {\tt csv} file.
\item The {\tt types} key that specifies what type of variables are to be written 
into the output table.
\end{enumerate}

If this all seems confusing, do not fret. The layout of the {\tt spec} file will make more sense 
as we continue to explain its various features. Again, more information about these keys can be 
found in the appendix.

We now discuss the {\tt fields} key in more detail.


\subsection{Field declarations} The edit-checking system needs to know the type and range
of every variable that has an associated edit. If a variable does not have an associated
edit, there is no need to declare its range.

The declaration of the edit variables contained in the {\tt fields} key consists of the field name, 
an optional type ({\tt int}, {\tt text}, or 
{\tt real}) to be discussed further below, and a list of valid values. Here is a typical example:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=]
fields {
    age: 0-100
    sex: M, F
    hh_type: int 1, 2, 4, 8
    income: real
}
\end{lstlisting}

In the above code, we've declared four variables: age, sex, hh\_type, and income and we've 
declared those four variables in different and valid ways. By doing this, the edit-checking system 
knows what to expect for each of these variables. You can see that the list of values may be text 
or numeric, and the range 0--100 will be converted into the full sequence 0, 1, 2, \dots, 100. 
By declaring our variables with a type and range, we can pass the information to the edit-checking system 
so that it knows what to verify when running its checks for each of these variables. 

When declaring a variable, the first word following the {\tt :} may be a type. For instance, 
for the {\tt hh\_type: int 1, 2, 4, 8} field above, we used the word 'int' to indicate that 
the data values of the field were of type integer. Notice as well that a type does not necessarily 
need to be declared; in which case the default action is to treat the entry as plain text (which means
that numeric entries get converted to text categories, like {\tt "1"}, {\tt "2"}, \dots). Keep in mind 
that if you declare the incorrect type for a field that the edit-checking system may not correctly 
verify the values of that field in your data set.

\paragraph{Auto-detect} If your field list consists of a single star, {\tt *} (the wild-card character 
in SQL that represents all possible inputs), then the data set will be queried for the list of values 
used in the input data. All values the variable takes on will be valid; all values not used 
by the variable will not be valid. Keep in mind that this can present problems if there are errors 
in your input data set.
In any case, using {\tt *} may be useful when quickly assembling a first draft of a spec, but we recommend
giving an explicit set of values for production. You may precede the {\tt *}
with a type designation, like {\tt age: real *}.


As you know, it is often necessary to impute data points in separate categories given 
the distribution of the data. For this, we use the {\tt recodes} key.

\subsection{Recodes}
In short, {\tt recode} keys are just new variables that are deterministic functions of 
existing data sets based on parameters given by you, the analyst. Based on the variables specified in the 
{\tt fields} key, you can "recode" those fields into other variables (which can be thought of as categories) 
based on paramters given in a certain syntax. This is often necessary to ensure that you are imputing 
your data over an accurate distribution. Observe the following typical example of a {\tt recodes} key:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=]
recodes {
    CATAGE {
        0 | age between 0 and 15
        1 | age between 16 and 64
        2 | age > 64
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Here, we have declared a new variable CATAGE whose data points are based off of a 
deterministic function of the variable AGEP. As we will see later, this recode will be called 
in the {\tt categories} key during imputation so that the data points we are attempting to 
impute will be imputed in categories based on their recode values rather than collectively 
as a single set of data points. The {\tt recodes} key is fairly straightforward, although we 
will learn about some of its more advanced features later. For now, however, we continue 
our walkthrough of the {\tt spec} file by discussing the {\tt checks} key.

\subsection{Checks}
The conistency-checking system is complex for efficiency purposes: there are typically a
few dozen to a few hundred checks that every observation must pass, from sanity checks
like {\em fail if age < 0} to real-world constraints like {\em fail if age < 16 and
status='married'}. Further, every time a change is made (such as by the imputation system)
we need to re-check that the new value does not fail checks. For example, an OLS imputation of age
could easily generate negative age values, so the consistency checks are essential
for verifying that the imputation process is giving us accurate and useable data points. In addition 
to error checking we can also use consistency checks for other purposes, such as setting 
{\em structural zeros} for the raking procedure.

All of the checks that are to be performed are specified here, in the {\tt checks} key. 
The checks you specify here will be performed on all input variables, as well as on all 
imputed data values. Let's take a look at an example {\tt checks} key:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=]
checks {
    	age < 0
        age > 95 => age = 95
       }
\end{lstlisting}

In the above example, we've indicated that the consistency checking system should verify that 
age is not less than 0 and that age is not greater than 95. Notice as well that when specifying 
that age > 95 we've also included the line 'age = 95' to indicate that when an age data point has 
a value higher than 95 that we should simply top-code it as 95. We haven't included an auto-declaration 
for age < 0 because if a data-point has a negative age value than it's indicative of a real error rather 
that should be properly imputed. It is up to you to decide when it is appropriate to utilize the 
auto-declaration feature.

We've now introduced the keys that precede the {\tt impute} key; and describe its functions below.


\subsection{Imputation} \label{imputesec}
The {\tt impute} key is fairly comprehensive and has several sub-keys that fulfill various 
roles in the imputation process. Many of the values of these sub-keys are derived from values 
found earlier in the {\tt spec} file; such as the fact that {\tt categories} is based off of 
the variables declared in {\tt recodes}. Take a look at the following example of an {\tt impute} key 
that is used to outline the imputation of the age variable described in the above keys:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=]

impute {
    input table: viewdc
    min group size: 3
    draw count: 3
    seed:2332

    categories {
        CATAGE
        SEX
    }

    method: hot deck
    output vars: age
}


\end{lstlisting}

As you can see, there is quite a bit going on here. Let's walk through each of the sub-keys 
above and see what they're doing:
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\tt input table} sub-key specifies the name of a view table to 
where you will write your recode variables. Recall that a view table is a digital SQL table 
that takes up very little memory and is very quick to render. In our example, we've indicated 
that the name of the view table to where our {\tt recode} variables will be written is 
called 'viewdc'. We'll be able to access this view table from R later when we actually 
compile our {\tt spec} file.\\
\item \ {\tt min group size}\ indicates the minimum number of known data points that can be 
used to impute any unknown data points. For instance, it wouldn't make much sense to use a single 
data point to impute five other data points as they would all end up being the same value. To 
prevent this, we set {\tt min group size: 3}.\\
\item \ {\tt draw count}\ determines the number of multiple imputations that should be performed. 
Because imputation is often done using stochastic models, it is often beneficial to obtain multiple 
imputed data sets. This will be explained in more detail later. For now, just know that the {\tt draw count} 
sub-key determines the number of multiple imputations that are performed.\\
\item \ {\tt seed}\ specifies the pseudo-random number generator seed that is used to obtain 
random numbers for stochastic imputation models. Keeping this seed the same will ensure that multiple imputations of the same data set will return the same outputs. Be sure to record the seeds you choose for your 
imputations so that other analysts can reference your data and replicate your imputations if necessary.\\
\item \ {\tt categories}\  specifies which recodes will be used to impute the data set for 
the given variable. For example, if CATAGE is listed in the {\tt categories} key then the 
data points that correspond to each of the three possible CATAGE values will be imputed 
separately. While it's not an absolute requirement that the {\tt categories} key be implemented, because data 
sets are typically imputed by categories you will most likely be using this key for almost all 
of your imputations.\\
\item \ {\tt method}\ specifies the type of model that is used to impute your data points. 
Choosing this model is itself a non-trivial task and is discussed more thoroughly later on 
in the tutorial.\\
\item \ {\tt output vars}\ specifies the variable whose data points are to be imputed. For this reason 
you could consider {\tt output vars} as both the 'input' variable as well as the 'output' variable 
to the model specified in {\tt method}.\\
\end{itemize}
More can be found on each of the above keys in the appendix.

\subsection{More features}
This concludes our walkthrough of a typical {\tt spec} file. By now you should have a basic idea of 
how a {\tt spec} file is implemented within TEA. Before we continue on to explaining more about imputation, 
the models available in TEA, and other features that are available within the TEA framework, we will mention 
two more features of the {\tt spec} file.

% Group recodes paragraph is incomplete and needs to be updated before being published.

\paragraph{Group recodes} The first feature that we'll mention is that of {\tt group recodes}. 
Often in an imputation model, after declaring your {\tt recodes}, it is also necessary to declare 
sub-recodes that are function of those earlier recodes. For example, suppose you had a {\tt spec} file 
in which you intended to impute data points for various members of households. Then to perform imputations 
on 


\begin{lstlisting}[language=]

recodes {
        EARN: case when WAGP<=0 then 'none' when WAGP>0 then 'black' else NULL end
        MOVE: case MIG when 1 then 'moved' else 'stayed' end
        DEG: case when SCHL in ('24','23','22','21','20') then 'degree' else 'non-degreed' end
        MF: case SEX when '1' then 'Male' when '2' then 'Female' else NULL end
        REL: case RELP when '00' then 'Householder' when '01' then 'Spouse' \
                        when '02' then 'Child' \
                        when '06' then 'Parent' else NULL end
}

group recodes {
    group id column: SERIALNO
    recodes {
                NP: max(SPORDER)
        NHH: sum(RELP='00')
        NSP: sum(RELP='01')
        NUP: sum(RELP='15')
                HHAGE: max(case RELP when '00' then AGEP end)
                SPAGE: max(case RELP when '01' then AGEP end)
                SPORD: max(case RELP when '01' then SPORDER end)
                HHSEX: cast(round(avg(case RELP when '00' then SEX end)) as integer)
                SPSEX: cast(round(avg(case RELP when '01' then SEX end)) as integer)
    }
}



\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Including} Up to this point, we've constructed the entire {\tt spec} file in a single file. 
Though this approach may 
be appropriate in some scenarios, it's often the case that you and your colleagues would like to make 
edits to the same {\tt spec} file and update or contruct it concurrently. To do this, you can simply mark 
subsidiary files to be included in the main spec file. Doing so allows you to easily combine these 
subsidiary files into one project through which all of TEA's routines will run.

The syntax for including is quite simple. To include a subsidiary file at a certain point in the {\tt spec} 
file, simply insert the key {\tt include: \textit{subsidiary\_file\_name}} at the line in the {\tt spec} 
file where you would like the contents of the subsidiary file to be inserted. For example, if you have 
written the consistency checks in a file named {\tt consistency}, and the entire rank swapping 
configuration was in a file named {\tt swap}, then you could use this parent spec file:

\begin{verbatim}
database: test.db

include: swap

checks {
    include: consistency
}
\end{verbatim}

Note that any subsidiary files that you choose to include in your {\tt spec} file must be in the same 
directory as the {\tt spec} file or it will not be able to find them.

This concludes our discussion of the {\tt spec} file layout and syntax. At this point, you should be 
able to implement a basic {\tt spec} file to impute any data set. More information about the keys 
discussed above and others that were not present in {\tt demo.spec} can be found in the appendix and 
at the r-forge website.

We now continue our tutorial by discussing imputation in more detail.

\section{Imputation}
Thus far we've seen how to impute a data set using a single {\tt impute} group. In this form, single 
imputation produces a list of replacement values for those data items that fail consistency checks 
or initially had no values. For the case of editing, the replacements would be for data that fails 
consistency checks; for the case of basic imputation, the replacements would be for elements that
initially had no values. Recall that as we stipulated earlier in the tutorial, for our purposes we 
consider a looser definition of imputation that includes the replacement of data points that both 
intially had no value as well as those that fail consistency checks.

In a similar vein, while single imputation gives us a single list of replacement values, any stochastic 
imputation method could be repeated to produce multiple lists of replacement values. For instance, 
we could utilize multiple imputation to calculate the variance of a given statistic, such as average 
income for a subgroup, as the sum of within-imputation variance and across-imputation variance.

To give a concrete example, consider a randomized hot deck routine, where missing values are
filled in by pulling values from similar records. For each record with a missing income:
\begin{enumerate}
\tighten
\item Find the universe of which the record is a member.
\item For each variable in turn:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Make a draw from model chosen for the variable, based on the specific universe from (1).
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


The simplest and most common example is the randomized hot deck, in which each survey respondent 
has a universe of other respondents whose data can be used to fill in the respondent's missing
values. The hot deck model is a simple random draw from the given universe for the given variable.

Given this framework, there are a wealth of means by which universes are formed, and
a wealth of models by which a missing value can be filled in using the data in the chosen universe.

\paragraph{Universes}
The various models described above are typically fit not for the whole data set, but for
smaller {\em universes}, such as a single county, or all males in a given age group.
A universe definition is an assertion that the variable set for the records in the
universe was generated in a different manner than the variables for other universes.

An assertion that two universes have different generative processes could be construed in
several ways:

\begin{itemize}\tighten
\item different mathematical forms, like CART vs.\ logistic regression
\item One broad form, like logistic regression, but with different variables chosen
    (that is, the stochastic form is the same but the structural form differs).
\item A unified form, like a logistic regression with age, sex, and ancestry
    as predictors, with different parameter estimates in each universe.
\end{itemize}

Universe definitions play a central role in the current ACS edit and imputation system.
Here, universes allow data analysts to more easily specify particular courses of
action in the case of missing or edit-inconsistent data items. To give an extreme example, for the imputation of marital status in ACS group quarters (2008), respondents are placed
in two major universes: less than 15 years of age (U1) and 15 or more years of age
(U2). The assertion here, thus, is that people older than 15 have a marital status
that comes from a different generative process than those people younger than 15.
This is true: people younger than 15 years of age cannot be married!  Thus in the
system, any missing value of marital status in U1 can be set to ``never married'',
and missing values in U2 can be allocated via the ACS hot-deck imputation system.

Now that we are more familar with universes, we can discuss the various models that are 
available in TEA and the methodology of choosing the one that is appropriate for the 
imputation being performed.


\section{Models}
Now that we're more familiar with the concept of universes, we examine how to choose the 
model that will give us the best results when imputing the data points in a specific universe.
Indeed, given an observation with a missing data point and a universe, however specified, there is
the problem of using the universe to fill in a value. Randomized hot-deck is again
the simplest model: simply randomly select an observation from the universe of acceptable
values and fill in. Other models make a stronger effort to find a somehow-optimal value:\\

$\bullet$ One could find the nearest neighbor to the data point to be imputed (using any
of a number of metrics).\\

$\bullet$ Income is typically log-Normally distributed, and log of this year's income, last
year's income, and if available, income reports from administrative records (\adrec) may
be modeled as Multivariate Normal (with a high correlation
coefficient among variables). After estimating the appropriate Multivariate
distribution for the universe, one could make draws from the distribution.\\

$\bullet$ If the Multivariate Normal seems implausible, one could simply aggregate the
data into an empirical multivariate PDF, then smooth the data into a kernel
density estimator (KDE). Draws from a specified KDE can be made as easily as
draws from a standard Multivariate Normal.\\

$\bullet$ Count data, such as the number of hospital visits over a given period, are
typically modeled as a Poisson distribution. In a manner similar to fitting a Normal, one
could find the best-fitting Poisson distribution and draw from that distribution to fill
in the missing observation.\\

$\bullet$ Bayesian methods: if \adrec are available, they may be used to generate a prior distribution
on a variable, which is then updated using non-missing data from the survey.\\

$\bullet$ One could do a simple regression using the data on hand. For example,
within the universe, regress income on  age, race, sex, and covariates from \adrec.
Once the regression coefficients are calculated, use them to impute income for
the record as the predicted value plus an error term. \comment{ Note that OLS assumes
a Normally-distributed error term and therefore gives a distribution of values for
the predicted income, not just a single number; therefore one could draw multiple
imputations.}\\

$\bullet$ Discrete-outcome models, like the Probit or Logit, could be used in a similar
manner.\\

$\bullet$ To expand upon running a single regression, one can conduct a structured search
over regression models for the best-fitting regression.\footnote{Because the imputation
step is not an inference step, such a search presents few conceptual difficulties.}
Such a search is currently in use for disclosure avoidance in ACS group quarters.\\

A unified framework would allow comparison across the various imputation
schemes and structured tests of the relative merits of each. Though different surveys
are likely to use different models for step (2) of the above process, the
remainder of the overall routine would not need to be rewritten across surveys.

We now discuss each of the models that are available in TEA.

\subsection{Models} This section describes the models available for use in imputing
missing data.

\paragraph{Hot deck} This is randomized hot deck. Missing values are filled in by
drawing from nonmissing values in the same subset. The assumption underlying the model
is {\em missing completely at random} (MCAR), basically meaning that nonrespondents
do not differ in a systematic way from respondents.

This model has no additional keys or options, although the user will probably want an
extensive set of category subsets. Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
impute{
    input table: dc
    min group size: 3
    draw count: 5
    id: serialno
                                                                             905,1         76%
   categories {
        agecat
        sex
    }
    output vars: sex
    method: hot deck
}

impute{
    input table: dc
    min group size: 3
    draw count: 5
    id: serialno

    categories {
        agecat
        sex
    }
    method: ols
                                                                             923,1         78%
utput vars: agep
    input vars: rac1p, nativity||sex
}
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Ordinary least squares (aka regression)}  This is the familiar $y = \beta_0
+ \beta_1 x_1  + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots +\epsilon$ form. The parameters (including the
variance of $\epsilon$) are estimated for the subset of the category where all variables
used in the regression are not missing. For a point where $y$ is missing but $(x_1, x_2, \dots)$ are not,find $\beta_1 x_1  + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots$, then add a random draw from the distribution of $\epsilon$.

The variables may be specified via the usual SQL, with two exceptions to accommodate the
fact that so many survey variables are categorical.
typical meaning.

\comment{
Because every dependent variable must be complete for the regression to calculate the
independent variable, it makes sense to put regressions in a sequence, with a spec file like:

\begin{lstlisting}
impute (first){
        models{
        rac1p { method: hot deck }
        nativity { method: hot deck }
        sex { method: hot deck }
        }
}

impute (second){
        models{
        agep { method: ols
               vars:  rac1p, nativity||sex
        }
        }
}
\end{lstlisting}

and then two steps in R:

\begin{lstlisting}
doMImpute(first)
doMImpute(second)
\end{lstlisting}
}

\paragraph{Probit and Logit} These models behave like OLS, but are aimed at categorical
variables. The output variable is not restricted to twoc categories.

\paragraph{seqRegAIC}


\paragraph{Distributions} The Normal (aka Gaussian) distribution is the archetype of this
type of model. First, estimate the mean and standard deviation using the non-missing data
in the category. Then fill in the missing data via random draws from the Normal
distribution with the calculated parameters. You may use either {\tt method: normal} or
{\tt method: gaussian}.

For other situations, other distributions may be peferable. For example, income is
typically modeled via {\tt method: lognormal}. Count data may best be modeled via {\tt
method: poisson}.

Hot deck is actually a fitting of the Multinomial distribution, in which each bin has
elements in proportion to that observed in the data; {\tt method: hot deck} and {\tt
method: multinomial} are synonyms.

The {\em method: multivariate normal} doesn't work yet.

The distribution models have no additional options or keys.

\paragraph{Kernel smoothing} A kernel density estimate overlays a Normal distribution over
every data point. For example, if a data set consisted of two data points at 10 and one at
12, then there would be a large hump in the final distribution at 10, a smaller hump at
12, and the distribution would be continuous over the entire space of reals.

Thus, kernel smoothing will turn a discrete distribution consisting of values on a
few values into a continuous distribution.

Invoke this model using either {\tt method: kernel} or {\tt method: kernel density}.

\section{Overlaying}
Each record in a data set might have several data items which require imputation for
different reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item a record could have several inconsistent items that we must replace
\item an otherwise consistent record could have a blank item that we wish to impute.
\item a record could have a combination of consistent items that could lead to personal identif
ication
\end{itemize}
Each scenario implies slightly different knowledge about the data, and thus each scenario
might require a different imputation method to properly use this knowledge.

An overlay is a secondary data table (or set of tables) that gives information regarding
the \emph{reason} for imputation.  Using missing data as an example, a simple overlay
could have an entry for each item in the data, indicating if that item is missing or not.
A more complicated overlay could delineate the type of non-response for each data item.

\todo{We have written but not incorporated an HTML viewer for data using overlay
information.}

\section{Raking}
Raking fills in a table where the totals for each column or row are known, but
individual cell values may vary. It can be shown to find the optimum given a
log-linear model on certain contrasts (i.e., a series of sets of dimensions).

The contrasts indicate which values are to remain fixed (while others may vary).
To give an example,
let us say that our data set is (age $\times$ se$\times$ $\times$ race $\times$ block), but
our log linear model is over the (race $\times$ block) contrast. A sample data set:

\begin{tabular}{rrrr}
age &sex &race &block\\
10  &M   &A    &1\\
20  &F   &A    &2\\
30  &M   &B    &3\\
40  &F   &B    &3
\end{tabular}

The raking algorithm would never be able to fill in a value in the cell (40, F, C, 3), for example, because
there are no Cs in block 3, and the (race X block) contrast guarantees that the counts of
each (race, block) total won't change. But that's our only assurance: (50, M, B, 3) is
possible, because age and sex totals could be raked into any value.

For this example, the set of cells that could have a value are:\\
(any age) $\times$ (M, F) $\times$ A $\times$ 1\\
(any age) $\times$ (M, F) $\times$ A $\times$ 2\\
(any age) $\times$ (M, F) $\times$ B $\times$ 3\\

The algorithm takes in the location of a data table in the database and a set of
contrasts, then rakes the data to fit the given contrasts.

\paragraph{Internals}
The Census Bureau often deals with tables that would have 1.5 million cells if written
out in full, but where only maybe 20,000 surveys are in hand. Therefore, the algorithm
is heavily oriented toward sparse data.

It begins with a long and tedious routine to write SQL to generate the set of
possibly-nonzero values, as per the example above. SQL is the appropriate language
for generating this list because it is optimized for generating the cross of several
variables and for pruning out values that match our criteria. The tedium turns out
to be worth it: our test data set takes about 25 seconds to run using the original
full-cross `72 algorithm, and runs in under two seconds using the SQL-pruned matrix.

\section{Synthesis}
Group quarters data in the 2010 Decennial census will be protected via
a method known as ``synthetic data''. This method uses statistical models to modify
records in need of confidentiality protection. Such a method has already been applied to
group quarters records in the American Community Survey for collection years 2006--2009.

\section{Weighting}
We use the {\em survey} package for R to calculate and modify weights for a
survey. The package is fully documented in \citet{lumley:surveys}.

\section{Models and Universes}
Statistical models are, in essence, an assertion about the \emph{process} that generates
the data. As such, useful models for imputation are those that imply processes that
we believe generate ACS GQ data items. Models are typically prescribed at the level
of variables; that is, we seek to describe the generative process of a set of variables
for a certain population.

A given variable set could have several distinct processes by which its values
are generated. In this case, it would be suboptimal to use only a single model to
perform imputation for this variable set. We group respondent records together into a
``universe'' when we believe their values for a given set of variables are generated
by the same process. Different sets of variables that require imputation could thus
require different universe definitions.

\subsection{Models}
Here, we list several models used to predict or fill in a missing element of
a record. The element could be missing because it was not reported (imputation),
because it was incorrectly reported (editing), or because leaving the correct value
as it lays would create disclosure risk. For any of these cases, any of the models to
follow could be applied. Note that these models are typically inserted into a larger
procedure; for example, a series of models could be used to fill in various data items.

{\bf Note on MI: to be ``proper'' MI models, they would need to produce
posterior predictive densities, so we might mention that deterministic
procedures don't fit the bill}

\subsubsection{Randomized hot deck/multinomial} This is a univariate method, that
randomly draws a value from the list of nonmissing values for the variable.
{\bf you can have a multivariate hot deck: we could get a value of A and B
from a cell defined by C and D}

\subsubsection{Nearest-neighbor} Based upon some metric defined by the user, find the
record closest to the record to be filled in, and copy the value(s) from that
record.

\subsubsection{Probabilistic nearest-neighbor} Define the odds of selecting a record
as inversely proportional to the record's distance to the record to be filled
in. That is, the nearest neighbor is the most likely to be selected, but others
may also be selected. After selecting a record, copy the value(s) as with
the deterministic nearest-neighbor model.

\subsubsection{Linear models} Given a complete-data subset, fit a generalized linear
model (GLM) to be specified by the user. The predictors used for a model could
be selected by hand or could be chosen automatically based on a given
criterion, such as the Akaike/Bayesian Information Criterion.
{\bf we could also suggest sequential models that start of predicting based
upon complete items; that is, if V1 is complete in the subset, first do
V2 \~{} V1, then V3 \~{} V1 + V2, etc; if nothing in complete, we could
always pick one to fill in randomly (that is, just use a prior)}

}

Recall that we had briefly discussed multiple imputation in the {\tt impute} section above. 
We now discuss this in more detail.

\section{Multiple Imputation}
A single imputation would produce a list of replacement
values for certain data items. Any stochastic imputation method could be repeated
to produce multiple lists of replacement values. Variance of a given statistic,
such as average income for a subgroup, is then the sum of within-imputation variance and
across-imputation variance.

\begin{itemize}
\tighten
\item For each imputation:
    \begin{itemize}
\tighten
    \item fill in the data set using the given set of imputed values
    \item calculate the within-imputation variance
    \end{itemize}
\item Sum the across-imputation and average within-imputation variances to
produce an overall variance figure that takes into account uncertainty due to imputation.
\end{itemize}

The question of what should be reported to the public from a sequence of imputations
remains open. The more extensive option would be to provide multiple data sets; the less
extensive option would be to simply provide a variance measure for each data point that
is not a direct observation.


\ifimputation
        \paragraph{Interface} Figure \ref{sippconfig} shows a (slightly abbreviated)
        configuration file describing the hot deck process for a variable in the SIPP.
        It is intended to be reasonably readable, and maintainable by an analyst who is
        a statistician but not a programmer.

        Lines 11--18 of the configuration specify the
        categories used for step (1) above: draws are made from the universe of records with an
        age in the same age category as the record to be filled in and {\tt num\_sipp\_jobs\_2008} in the same
        category as well.

        Of course, different surveys would have different classification schemes, but
        this means that each survey would need a new configuration file, not new code.

        Line eight indicates that five imputations are to be done for each missing
        value. Those with extensive experience with multiple imputation often advise
        that a handful of imputations are sufficient for most purposes.

        The sample from
        Figure \ref{sippconfig} focused on the determination of categories in which to
        do imputation. Figure \ref{acsconfig} focuses on regression models that go
        beyond the simple randomized hot deck of Figure \ref{sippconfig}. Lines 5--8
        specify the variables that need imputation, and the form of model to be used.
        The current system will search the set of models of the given form for the one
        that best fits the known data; Lines 9--14 show the list of variables that could be
        used as explanatory variables, although a typical model will likely wind up
        using only around four or five.

     \paragraph{Edits} The system as written includes a component that checks consistency
        against a sequence of edits. In line three of the sample spec file of Figure
        \ref{sippconfig}, the {\tt flagearn} variable is declared to have possible values of 0,
        1, 3, or 4, but line four specifies that if an imputation returns 4, then it is rejecte
d.
        The imputation routine sketched above does not need to include any edit rules, because
        this edit step will take those into account; the separation of edits and imputations
        simplifies the routine.

{Interactive R}
The specification file described to this point does nothing by itself, but provides
information to procedures written in R that do the work. The analyst would therefore write
a script that calls the needed procedures in sequence. For example, this script loads the
TEA library into R's memory, reads the spec file, fixes inconsistencies, and imputes
missing values.
