The dotFiles in this folder are written to facilitate the composition of the 
larger graphviz dotFile by separating it into separate dot files for each 
main key of the spec file.

When updating and/or writing a new dot file that will be part of the main 
dot file, leave out the digraph { ... } and node [shape=Mrecord]; tags as 
those are both included as part of the script in the main dot file output 
(called connected_dot_file).
